# Market Segmentation in Banking Sector


## Introduction

Market segmentation in the banking sector involves dividing customers into distinct groups based on certain characteristics or behaviors. In this project, I have used the K-Means clustering technique to identify segmentation patterns within a dataset without any predefined labels.

## About the Dataset

The dataset contains records of approximately 9000 active credit card holders over the last 6 months, along with 17 different behavioral variables. These variables include balance frequency, purchases, one-off purchases, installment purchases, cash advance, purchase frequency, one-off purchase frequency, purchase installments frequency, cash advance frequency, cash advance TRX, purchases TRX, credit limit, and payments.

## Project Process

1. **Research**: Before tackling a problem, the initial step was precisely defining it and converting data inquiries into actionable insights.
   
2. **Data Pre-processing**: This step involved data manipulation, cleaning, and ensuring minimal noise in the dataset.
   
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Examining data closely to understand what's important, typically using graphs and visualization techniques.
   
4. **Model Building**: Selecting the appropriate machine learning model, training the dataset, and further tuning it to improve accuracy. For clustering, I opted for the K-Means algorithm.

## K-Means Clustering

- K-Means clustering is a method in machine learning used to group data points into K clusters based on similarities.
  
- It starts by placing K centroids randomly, assigning each point to the nearest centroid, recalculating centroids based on these assignments, and repeating until centroids stabilize. This process aims to group similar data points together.

## Finding Optimal K Value

The elbow method is utilized to find the optimal K value (number of clusters). By analyzing the graph, K=4 is determined as the point where it tends to bend or make an elbow joint, hence selecting K=4 as the optimal K value.

## K-Means Cluster

Clusters generated by the K-Means clustering algorithm are presented, showing 4 distinct clusters.

## Some More Insights

A graph illustrates how the variable "Purchase Frequency" is distinctive among different clusters. Additionally, a countplot shows the total number of unique data points in each cluster.

## Conclusion

K-Means clustering effectively classifies customers based on their financial behavior, making it a standout choice for market segmentation in the banking industry. Utilizing K-Means clustering allows for targeted marketing campaigns, customized financial products, and improved customer service tailored to specific customer segments.

Since most of the data is not labeled, this unsupervised algorithm emerges as the perfect choice for clustering data points.
